# Model-Based-AI-Agent
 AI agent to clean boarding gate areas at an airport at certain intervals throughout the day.
Question: An airport normally outsources cleaning services. Cleaners check the boarding gate areas after every two hours (throughout the day) and clean dirty areas.  In a bid to cut cost, the airport would like to make use of automated vacuum cleaner to perform this task. Design a prototype that makes the same number of visits as the cleaners and test it in four boarding gate areas. In order to optimize power consumption, the vacuum cleaner should monitor its performance halfway through the day and increase the visits to every one hour or reduce to every three hours depending on the status of the rooms as observed in previous visits. For example if during the past six visits the rooms were dirty in over 50% of the visits then the cleaning visits should be increased.

•Write the program that simulates the agent. The status of the boarding areas and location of the agent should be randomly generated. The program should display the status of the environment before and after cleaning, alongside the cleaning hour.
